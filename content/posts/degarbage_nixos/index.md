## In case you're like me new to NixOS...

<p class="notice_info"><strong><em>...you may not have noticed that it is obligatory to declare certain lines for automatic garbage collection in your configuration.nix. Otherwise, you might end up in the worst-case scenario with not a single free inode left to link.<br><br>
I use <abbr title="modern file system format">btrfs</abbr> and had already completed <abbr title="BUILDS are called GENERATIONS in nix">120 builds</abbr> when my system crashed during the 121st build process, displaying an error like "no space left on device," even though I had a few hundred unused gigabytes available.<br><br>
It turned out that hundreds of thousands of files and system links had been created over time, which consumed all of my <abbr title="Inodes are essential on Unix-like systems (such as Linux-based OS) for storing metadata of files. They may get consumed long before the memory capacity of their volume is exceeded.">inodes</abbr>. I assume that old links were not deallocated and that nixos preserved a totally useless software package release history on my disk. At that point, it became <abbr title="Because every new build consumes new inodes without freeing old ones">impossible to rebuild nixos.</abbr></em></strong></p> 

<p class="notice_danger"><strong> ‚ùå Result: You can't simply <abbr title="to comment smth out causes nixos to build a new system profile, old packages persist as orphanes">comment out something in the configuration.nix</abbr> or declare garbage collection rules there, because it's too late. You can't fix this via the configuration.nix file at all.</strong></p>

# Collecting evidence

## [üß©] Check Disk Usage $:>
Let us begin with printing the disk usage with the <abbr title="disk free">df</abbr> tool out, to rule this out.
```sh
df -h
```

```

### Interpretation: 

<p class="notice_success">‚úÖ 40% of <abbr title="the line where / is in the row of 'Mounted on'">system root directory</abbr> are free and theres also no sub-partition mounted in root besides boot and tempfs. So the "no space left" error was not caused by lack of overall disk space.</p>

## Correct inode measurement depends on your partition format 

Every partition format uses its own technique to preserve or balance a contingent of inodes. Inodes are responsible for storing file-related metadata, like systemlinks, timestamps, ownership, access rights and so on. 
## [üß©] Optional: check your btrfs, if present $:>
```sh
sudo btrfs filesystem usage /

### A.2. Check the inode consumption

###### [ üß© ]-(`Code Snippet`) :
```sh
df -i
