## A Examining disk usage and inode consumption statistics on `btrfs`, `ext4` and `xfs` 

To put an emphasize on slightly differences between some random filesystem types i was able to examine.

### [üß©] A.1 Check Disk Usage
Let us begin with printing the disk usage with the <abbr title="disk free">df</abbr> tool out, to rule this out.
```sh
df -h
```
```
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
devtmpfs        1,6G     0  1,6G   0% /dev
tmpfs            16G   63M   16G   1% /dev/shm
tmpfs           7,7G  7,1M  7,7G   1% /run
/dev/dm-1       457G  266G  185G  60% /
efivarfs        128K   41K   83K  33% /sys/firmware/efi/efivars
tmpfs           1,0M     0  1,0M   0% /run/credentials/systemd-journald.service
tmpfs           1,0M     0  1,0M   0% /run/credentials/systemd-tmpfiles-setup-dev-early.service
tmpfs           1,0M     0  1,0M   0% /run/credentials/systemd-tmpfiles-setup-dev.service
tmpfs            16G  2,0M   16G   1% /run/wrappers
tmpfs           1,0M     0  1,0M   0% /run/credentials/systemd-vconsole-setup.service
/dev/nvme0n1p3  4,3G   87M  4,2G   2% /boot
tmpfs           1,0M     0  1,0M   0% /run/credentials/systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service
/dev/sda4       458G  351G   84G  81% /mnt/ssd
/dev/sdb3       873G  733G   96G  89% /mnt/hdd
tmpfs           1,0M     0  1,0M   0% /run/credentials/systemd-sysctl.service
tmpfs           3,1G  200K  3,1G   1% /run/user/1000
```

### Interpretation (`df -h`) 

<p class="notice_success">‚úÖ 40% of <abbr title="the line where / is in the row of 'Mounted on'">system root directory</abbr> are free and theres also no sub-partition mounted in root besides boot and tempfs. Therefore the "no space left" error was not caused by a lack of overall disk space.</p>

<br>
If you simply don't have disk space left, because you have also forgotten to declare garbage collection cycles, you could do this now manually by continuing from <a href="">here.</a> Otherwise wipe some gigabites and consider to extend your partition.
<br><br>

## B Checking out the inode consumption with <abbr title="disk free -inodes">df -i</abbr>

### [üß©] B.1 Optional: btrfs
```sh
df -i
```

### Interpretation (btrfs)

<p class="notice_danger">‚ùå df -i can't read the inode consumption of my btrfs root partition, resulting in an output of <code>0/0/0/-</code>.</p> 

## C Choosing the correct inode measurement tool depends on the filesystem format 

Every partition format uses its own technique to preserve or balance a contingent of inodes. Inodes are responsible for storing file-related metadata, like systemlinks, timestamps, ownership, access rights and so on. 

### [üß©] C.1 Optional - check out btrfs, if present $:>
```sh
sudo btrfs filesystem usage /
```

```

/dev/mapper/luks-4b890b26-f927-468e-9ce2-ead3d942224f	  16.00MiB
```

### Interpretation (`btrfs filesystem usage`): 

<p class="notice_success">‚úÖ Actually i must have enough space for inode allocation left. On this <code>btrfs</code> partition, only <strong>59.46%</strong> of the preserved space for Metadata/DUP was consumed. This is no surprise, because i already have fixed this. But if you actually don't have any space left, please continue <a href="">here</a> to call the garbage collector and consider also to perform a btrfs scrub.</p>

Let's focus on this part of the previous output:

```
Metadata,DUP: Size:8.00GiB, Used:4.76GiB (59.56%)
/dev/mapper/luks-4b890b26-f927-468e-9ce2-ead3d942224f	  16.00GiB
```

The reserved space for metadata equals 16.00<abbr title="A gibibyte is a more technical unit of memory size than a gigabyte. Gibibytes are based on powers of two, which fit perfectly with binary processing.">GiB</abbr> of total disk space but de-facto only 8.00GiB are allocatable for metadata or inodes. These 8.00GiB are mirrored to maximize file consistency. There should always be a backup, just in case. I guess **DUP** simply means _duplicate_.

### [üß©] C.2 Optional: ext4

My root partition on my Fedora system is formatted with ext4. I'm providing `df -i` for a comparison:

```sh
df -i
```

```

### Interpretation (ext4)

<p class="notice_success">‚úÖ <code>df -i</code> is able to read and process inode statistics of ext4 partitions</p>
### [üß©] C.3 Optional: xfs

Also for comparison reasons i called for `df -i` statistics from my MX Linux machine with a xfs formated root partition.

```sh
df -i
```

```

```

### Interpretation (xfs)

<p class="notice_success">‚úÖ <code>df -i</code> is also able to read and process inode statistics of xfs partitions</p>

## D Comparison of btrfs, ext4 and xfs

<p class="notice_info">Depending on your partition type you must find the correct tool to gather the wanted information about actual inode consumption.<br>E.g. for btrfs i would go for the <a href="/posts/degarbage_nixos/#[%F0%9F%A7%A9]_Optional_-_check_out_btrfs,_if_present_$:%3E">btrfs usage tool</a> and then check the metadata paragraph.<br><br>For at least `ext4` and `xfs` filesystems will `df -i` do the trick</p>
