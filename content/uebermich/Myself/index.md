## 2019-2024: IT coordinator at a metropolitan medical diagnostics center

<p>
Self‑reliantly, I revolutionized the diagnosis center’s heavily customized and decades-grown IT infrastructure by 

identifying the common and individual properties of every system, system cluster, and system class. Then backing up and rebuilding or hardening each one individually while adhering to regulatory security policies.
